# CredentialManager

This project aims to build a credential managers capable of doing everything locally, without the need for a remove server or database. It currently offers only a command-line interface (CLI), which **may be** replaced/accompanied by a graphic user interface (GUI) in the future, and stores all credentials locally and securely by using encrypted SQLite databases.

# CredentialManager

This project aims to build a credential managers capable of doing everything locally, without the need for a remote server or database. It currently offers only a command-line interface (CLI), which **may be** replaced/accompanied by a graphic user interface (GUI) in the future, and stores all credentials locally and securely by using encrypted SQLite databases. Although the 'local-only' premise, this tool does actually support portability, but it is limited to its import and export features (you can import and export the encrypted vaults containing your credentials).

The project is currently under development, therefore it may be ridden with bugs and incomplete features, it should not be used for actual credential storing just yet. Like for most open-source projects, caution is advised when using the tool, use it as per your own discretion.
